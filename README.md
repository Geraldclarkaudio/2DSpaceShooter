2D Space Shooter
This game was created as part of the GameDevHQ course for Unity Developers. I created all systems in this game from scratch including player movement, spawn managers, power ups, and wave systems. 
This game will have two versions. 1 version will include Wwise as the audio engine. The other version will include Unity's audio engine. 
Since Wwise does not support WebGL builds, I needed to make 2 versions. The Wwise version has some adaptive music, and makes use of switch groups when dealing with power up sound effects.
Articles describing my process for making these features exist here!
